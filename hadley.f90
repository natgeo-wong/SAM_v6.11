! This subroutine solves for perturbation omega based on WTG approximation as
! described in the appendix of Blossey, Bretherton & Wyant (2009):
!
!   http://dx.doi.org/10.3894/JAMES.2009.1.8
!
!  - original version: Peter Blossey (pblossey at gmail dot com), 
!                      September 2009 based on earlier implementaion in SAM.
!
! Note 1: this version handles the situation where the model top is
!   below the tropopause gracefully.  The boundary condition at the
!   tropopause (omega'=0) is enforced by adding additional levels
!   between the model top and the tropopause (whose height is assumed
!   to be 100 hPa if it is above the model top).
!
! Note 2: Below the tropopause, the temperature will be modified
!   by the WTG method through large-scale vertical motion.
!   Above the tropopause, the temperature should be nudged 
!   to the observed profile on a longish (~2 day?) timescale.
!
! Note 3: The wrapper routine allows the code to handle models
!   that index their pressure, temperature and moisture soundings
!   from either the surface-upwards or the top-downwards.  The driver
!   routine assumes that these soundings are indexed from the surface
!   upwards as in SAM, the model for which this routine was first
!   written.
